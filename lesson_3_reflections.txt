When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you're unable to use a particular computer for too long
-When you want others to edit a file as well

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-You'll have more control over when changes get pulled
