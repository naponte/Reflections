When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you're unable to use a particular computer for too long
-When you want others to edit a file as well

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-You'll have more control over when changes get pulled

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-clone: creates a duplicate of a file/repositoty which is independent of the original
-fork: clone of a project on Github's server's side
-Branch: creates a new update path

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-Allows you to keep working on the remote even if you lack internet

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-I would probably use Google Docs or something similar
-What would be easier/harder would depend on what I used
